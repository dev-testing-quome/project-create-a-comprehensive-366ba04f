# project-create-a-comprehensive

## Overview

This project implements a HIPAA-compliant patient portal application built using FastAPI, React, and SQLite.  The application allows patients to securely access their medical records, schedule appointments, manage prescriptions, and communicate with healthcare providers via encrypted messaging.  It prioritizes security and data privacy through features such as multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and end-to-end encryption where applicable.

## Features

**User-Facing Functionality:**

* **Secure Login with Multi-Factor Authentication:**  Robust authentication to protect patient data.
* **Medical Record Access:** View, download, and manage personal medical records.
* **Appointment Scheduling:** Schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments with providers.
* **Prescription Management:** View prescriptions, request refills, and track prescription status.
* **Secure Messaging:** Communicate with healthcare providers through encrypted messaging.
* **Secure File Uploads:** Upload medical documents securely.
* **Real-time Notifications:** Receive notifications for appointment confirmations and lab results.

**Technical Highlights:**

* **HIPAA Compliance Considerations:**  The application is designed with HIPAA compliance in mind, although full HIPAA compliance requires a comprehensive security and privacy audit by a qualified professional.  Key considerations include data encryption, access controls, and audit logging (not fully implemented in this basic example).
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Different access levels for patients and healthcare staff.
* **Data Encryption:**  Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit (implementation details to be documented).
* **API Versioning:**  Support for API versioning to manage changes and maintain backward compatibility.


## Technology Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) with SQLAlchemy ORM
* **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
* **Database**: SQLite (For development and testing.  Production deployment would require a more robust database solution like PostgreSQL.)
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **Encryption Library (Placeholder):**  [Specify encryption library used - e.g., cryptography]


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm or yarn
* Docker (optional, but recommended for development and deployment consistency)
* A text editor or IDE


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application:**

   * **Backend (from `backend` directory):**
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

   * **Frontend (from `frontend` directory):**
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```


### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, the interactive API documentation is available at:

* **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**(Example Endpoints - Placeholder - Replace with actual endpoints and examples)**

* **Patient Login:**  `POST /api/v1/auth/login`  (Requires username, password, and potentially MFA token).  Response includes JWT token.
* **Appointment Scheduling:** `POST /api/v1/appointments` (Requires patient ID, provider ID, date, time).
* **Get Patient Records:** `GET /api/v1/patients/{patient_id}/records` (Requires authentication).


**(Sample Request/Response - Placeholder - Replace with actual examples)**

```json
# Sample POST request for appointment scheduling
{
  "patient_id": 123,
  "provider_id": 456,
  "date": "2024-03-15",
  "time": "14:00"
}

# Sample Response
{
  "appointment_id": 789,
  "status": "scheduled"
}
```
