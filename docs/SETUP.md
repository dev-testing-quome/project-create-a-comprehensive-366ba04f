# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the setup process for developers working on the "create-a-comprehensive" HIPAA-compliant patient portal application.  This application is complex and requires careful attention to security best practices.  This guide assumes a basic understanding of software development and command-line interfaces.


## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * Python 3.9+
    * Node.js 16+
    * Docker Desktop (for Docker option)
    * PostgreSQL 14+ (or your chosen database, adjustments needed in the guide)
* **Development Tools:**
    * Git
    * Text editor or IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:** Install extensions for Python, JavaScript, Docker, and PostgreSQL support. Configure linters (e.g., ESLint, Pylint) and formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black).
    * **IntelliJ IDEA:** Similar to VS Code, install relevant plugins and configure linters and formatters.


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

This option simplifies setup by containerizing the application and its dependencies.

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup Commands:**
   Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running.

3. **Development docker-compose Configuration:**
   The project should include a `docker-compose.yml` file defining the services (frontend, backend, database).  A sample might look like this:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     web:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - api
         - db
     api:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=<your_db_url>
         - SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
         # ... other environment variables
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=<your_db_user>
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
         - POSTGRES_DB=<your_db_name>
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**
   For the frontend (React, Vue, etc.), use a tool like `nodemon` or a browser extension for hot reloading.  For the backend (Flask, Django, etc.), consider using a development server with automatic reloading capabilities.


### Option 2: Native Development

This option requires installing dependencies directly on your system.

1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming a requirements.txt file exists
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:**
   Install PostgreSQL and create a database. Configure the database connection details in your application's configuration files (e.g., `database.yml`).


## Environment Configuration

1. **Required Environment Variables:**  These will vary depending on your application's architecture. Examples include:
    * `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string.
    * `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for session management.
    * `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USERNAME`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Email configuration for notifications.
    * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`:  For AWS S3 storage (if used for file uploads).

2. **Local Development .env File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your local environment variables.  **Never commit `.env` to version control.**

3. **Configuration for Different Environments:** Use a configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) to manage settings for different environments (development, staging, production).


## Running the Application

1. **Start Commands for Development:**
   * **Docker:** `docker-compose up -d`
   * **Native:**  Start the backend server (e.g., `python manage.py runserver` for Django), then start the frontend development server (e.g., `npm start`).

2. **How to Access Frontend and Backend:** The frontend will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port) and the backend API at `http://localhost:8000` (or a similar port).

3. **API Documentation Access:**  Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to generate and serve API documentation.


## Development Workflow

1. **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:** Use Git for version control. Adopt a branching strategy like Gitflow (feature branches, develop branch, main branch).

2. **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:** Use linters (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python) and formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black) to maintain consistent code style.  Configure your IDE to automatically run these tools.

3. **Testing Procedures:** Write unit and integration tests using appropriate frameworks (e.g., pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript).

4. **Debugging Setup:** Use your IDE's debugger or command-line debuggers to troubleshoot issues.


## Database Management

1. **Running Migrations:** Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage database schema changes.

2. **Seeding Development Data:** Create scripts to seed your database with sample data for development and testing.

3. **Database Reset Procedures:** Implement procedures to easily reset the database to a clean state.


## Testing

1. **Running Unit Tests:** Use your testing framework's command to run unit tests (e.g., `pytest` for Python, `jest` for JavaScript).

2. **Running Integration Tests:**  Design integration tests to verify interactions between different parts of your application.

3. **Test Coverage Reports:** Generate test coverage reports to track the percentage of code covered by tests.


## Common Development Tasks

1. **Adding New API Endpoints:**  Follow your API design guidelines and write appropriate tests.

2. **Adding New Frontend Components:**  Use your frontend framework's component structure and ensure proper integration with the backend API.

3. **Database Schema Changes:**  Use database migration tools to manage schema changes and update related code.

4. **Adding Dependencies:** Use `pip` (Python) and `npm` (JavaScript) to add and manage dependencies.


## Troubleshooting

1. **Common Setup Issues:** Consult the documentation for Docker, PostgreSQL, Python, and Node.js.

2. **Port Conflicts Resolution:** Change ports in your configuration files if there are conflicts.

3. **Dependency Issues:** Check your `requirements.txt` (Python) and `package.json` (JavaScript) files for dependency conflicts. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

4. **Environment Variable Problems:** Ensure your environment variables are correctly set and accessible to your application.


## Contributing

1. **Code Style Guidelines:** Adhere to the project's code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style guide for JavaScript).

2. **Pull Request Process:** Create pull requests for code changes and follow the project's review process.

3. **Issue Reporting:** Report bugs and feature requests using the project's issue tracker.


Remember to replace placeholders like `<repository_url>`, `<your_db_url>`, etc., with your actual values.  This guide provides a foundation;  specific commands and configurations will depend on the chosen technologies and project structure.  Always prioritize security best practices when developing a HIPAA-compliant application.  Consult HIPAA regulations and relevant security standards throughout the development process.
