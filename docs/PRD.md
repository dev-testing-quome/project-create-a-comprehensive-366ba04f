## Product Requirements Document: Secure Patient Portal

**1. Title:**  project-create-a-comprehensive: HIPAA-Compliant Patient Portal

**2. Overview:**

This document outlines the requirements for "project-create-a-comprehensive," a HIPAA-compliant patient portal built using FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend). This application will empower patients to securely access and manage their healthcare information, improving communication and engagement with their healthcare providers.  The value proposition lies in enhanced patient experience, improved care coordination, and increased efficiency for healthcare providers through a secure and user-friendly platform.


**3. Functional Requirements:**

* **Patient Features:**
    * **Secure Login with MFA:**  Two-factor authentication (e.g., using Google Authenticator or similar) is mandatory.
    * **Medical Record Access:** View medical history, lab results, imaging reports, and other relevant documents.  Ability to download documents in common formats (PDF, etc.).
    * **Appointment Scheduling:** View upcoming appointments, request new appointments, reschedule existing appointments, and receive appointment reminders.
    * **Prescription Management:** View current prescriptions, request refills, and receive notifications regarding prescription status.
    * **Secure Messaging:**  Encrypted communication with healthcare providers.
    * **Secure File Upload:** Upload medical documents (e.g., insurance cards, test results from external providers).
    * **Profile Management:** Update personal information (address, phone number, emergency contact).

* **Healthcare Provider Features (Role-Based Access):**
    * **Patient Management:** View and manage patient records.
    * **Appointment Management:** Manage appointment schedules, view patient calendars.
    * **Prescription Management:** Approve or deny prescription refills.
    * **Secure Messaging:** Communicate with patients through the secure messaging system.
    * **Reporting and Analytics:** Access dashboards with key performance indicators (KPIs).

* **Data Management Requirements:**
    * **Data Encryption:**  All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (AES-256, etc.).
    * **Data Auditing:**  Comprehensive audit trails for all data access and modifications.
    * **Data Backup and Recovery:**  Regular data backups and a robust disaster recovery plan.
    * **Data Integrity:**  Mechanisms to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

* **Integration Requirements:**
    * **Electronic Health Record (EHR) Integration:**  Seamless integration with existing EHR systems (specific EHR system to be determined).  API specifications will need to be defined for this integration.
    * **Pharmacy Integration:**  Integration with pharmacy systems for prescription management (specific pharmacy systems to be determined). API specifications will need to be defined for this integration.
    * **Payment Gateway Integration:**  Integration with a secure payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for optional online billing.


**4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance Requirements:**  The application must be responsive and load quickly.  Specific response time requirements will be defined based on user testing.
* **Security Requirements:**  HIPAA compliance is mandatory. This includes robust authentication, authorization, data encryption, and regular security audits.  Penetration testing will be required.
* **Scalability Requirements:** The application must be able to handle a growing number of users and data without performance degradation.  Load testing will be conducted to determine scalability limits.
* **Usability Requirements:** The application must be intuitive and easy to use for both patients and healthcare providers.  Usability testing will be conducted throughout the development process.


**5. Technical Requirements:**

* **Technology Stack:**
    * Backend: FastAPI (Python)
    * Frontend: React.js
    * Database: PostgreSQL (with appropriate extensions for data encryption and auditing)
* **API Specifications:**  RESTful APIs will be used for communication between the frontend and backend.  Detailed API specifications will be documented using OpenAPI/Swagger.
* **Database Schema Considerations:**  A detailed database schema will be designed to ensure data integrity and security.  This will include considerations for data normalization, indexing, and encryption.
* **Third-Party Integrations:**  Specific APIs and SDKs will be utilized for EHR, pharmacy, and payment gateway integrations.


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Each feature will have specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) acceptance criteria defined in a separate document.**  Examples include: successful login with MFA, successful retrieval of medical records, successful scheduling of appointments, etc.
* **Success Metrics and KPIs:**  Key performance indicators will include user engagement (login frequency, feature usage), system uptime, and security metrics.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  UAT will be conducted with representative users to ensure the application meets their needs.


**7. Release Criteria:**

* **MVP Definition:** The MVP will include secure login with MFA, patient medical record access, appointment scheduling, and secure messaging.
* **Launch Readiness Checklist:**  A comprehensive checklist will be used to verify that all requirements are met before launch.  This will include security audits, performance testing, and UAT completion.
* **Post-Launch Monitoring:**  Continuous monitoring of system performance, security, and user feedback will be conducted post-launch.


**8. Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* **Technical Assumptions:**  The availability of reliable third-party APIs for EHR, pharmacy, and payment gateway integration.
* **Business Assumptions:**  Sufficient funding and resources will be available throughout the development process.  Regulatory compliance with HIPAA will be maintained.
* **External Dependencies:**  The availability and responsiveness of third-party APIs.


**9. Risks and Mitigation:**

* **Technical Risks:**  Integration challenges with third-party systems, security vulnerabilities.
    * **Mitigation:**  Thorough testing and contingency planning.  Regular security audits and penetration testing.
* **Business Risks:**  Insufficient funding, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals.
    * **Mitigation:**  Secure adequate funding, proactive communication with regulatory bodies.


**10. Next Steps:**

* **Development Phases:**  Agile development methodology will be used, with iterative sprints and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).
* **Timeline Considerations:**  A detailed project timeline will be developed based on the complexity of each feature and the availability of resources.
* **Resource Requirements:**  The project will require a team of developers, designers, testers, and project managers.


**11. Conclusion:**

This PRD provides a comprehensive framework for the development of a HIPAA-compliant patient portal application.  By adhering to the requirements outlined in this document, we can deliver a secure, user-friendly, and valuable application that improves patient care and healthcare provider efficiency.  Regular reviews and updates to this document will be necessary throughout the development lifecycle.
